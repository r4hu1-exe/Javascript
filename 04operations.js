// calculating operation like 2+2=4
//value = 2
//negValue = -value
//console.log(negValue);

//console.log(2+2+3);
//console.log(2**3) // 2 raise to power of 2
//console.log(2%3) //for 2 is to 3 remainder===>Cryptography

//string1 = "hii"
//string2 = " aman"
//string3 = string1 + string2
//console.log(string3)

//=====================Some interesting parts of operation in Javascript========

//console.log("1" + 2);  /// ans==> 12 how?  its printing  1 and 2 both
//console.log(1 + 2 + "23") //if the int is in staring then the int will be added and and string will be printed as it is
 //In first case string was first and after that integer is printed
 //console.log("5" + 2 + 3 + 5) //===> 5235 it is directly printing the no. (taking all int also a string)
//This happen because of some rules in js
//use parenthesis () to solve it
//console.log( (3+4) * 5 % 3); //dont code like this wrong way of coding


//console.log(true); // true
//console.log(+true); //get converted into 1 means true
//console.log(true+) //it will throw an error

//if given empty paraenthesis +"" it will give negavtive of boolean means 0

console.log(+""); // it will give u zero

//=============Assignment operation=================
//not a good way to write a code

//let num1, num2, num3
//num1 = num2 = num3 = 2 + 2 
//console.log(num1)

//==========================Prefix and Postfix Operators===========
//Eg of Postfix
gameCounter = 500
gameCounter++  ///for Increasing value of gamecounter the o/p will ressult in 501
console.log(gameCounter);

//Eg of Prefix
gameCounter = 500
++gameCounter  ///for Increasing value of gamecounter the o/p will ressult in 501
console.log(gameCounter);


//Assignment learn about prefix and postfix on MDN
